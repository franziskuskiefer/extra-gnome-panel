extra-gnome-panel
=================

GNOME Shell extension to display a panel on every monitor

This is a simplified version of the [Multiple Monitor Panels](https://github.com/darkxst/multiple-monitor-panels/) extension without all the fancy stuff.
Just the black panel bar on top.

Install
------------
Get the extra-gnome-panel... folder and put it into ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
